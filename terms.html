    <p>Welcome to <strong>My Zen Place</strong> (the “App”) and our website <a href="https://www.my-zen-place.com" rel="noopener">my-zen-place.com</a> (the “Site”). These Terms &amp; Conditions (“Terms”) form a binding agreement between you and us concerning your use of the App and the Site.

  </div>
</header>

<main>
  <h2>1) Who we are &amp; how to contact us</h2>
  <p><strong>My Zen Place</strong> (“we”, “us”, “our”) operates the App and Site. For support or questions, use the contact form on the Site or email <a href="mailto:support@my-zen-place.com">support@my-zen-place.com</a>.</p>

  <h2>2) Eligibility</h2>
  <p>You must be the age of majority in your jurisdiction to accept these Terms, or have a parent/guardian accept them for you. You are responsible for compliance with local laws when you use the App or Site.</p>

  <h2>3) The App &amp; Site; license to you</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>License:</strong> We grant you a personal, non-transferable, non-exclusive, revocable license to install and use the App on devices you own or control and to access the Site, solely for personal, non-commercial use.</li>
    <li><strong>Offline by design:</strong> The App runs offline and stores your creations locally on your device.</li>
    <li><strong>No analytics/ads:</strong> The App contains no third-party analytics or advertising SDKs. See our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for details.</li>
    <li><strong>Updates:</strong> We may provide updates or changes that are required for continued use; features may change or be discontinued.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) Your content &amp; ownership</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Your creations:</strong> Scenes/gardens you make in the App remain on your device. We do not receive or host them.</li>
    <li><strong>Feedback:</strong> If you send ideas or feedback, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free license to use them to improve the App/Site, without any obligation to you.</li>
    <li><strong>Our IP:</strong> The App, Site, code, art, audio, logos, and trademarks are owned by us or our licensors and protected by law. You may not copy, modify, reverse engineer, or redistribute the App except as allowed by law or by these Terms.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5) Prohibited uses</h2>
  <p>You agree not to misuse the App or Site. For example, you will not: (a) attempt to access non-public areas; (b) interfere with operation or security; (c) decompile or reverse engineer the App except as permitted by law; (d) infringe IP rights; (e) use the App for unlawful, harmful, or abusive purposes; or (f) circumvent technical protections.</p>

  <h2>6) Purchases, pricing &amp; refunds</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Platform stores:</strong> If you purchase the App through Apple App Store or Google Play, pricing and taxes are determined by the platform. Any refunds are handled by the respective store’s policies.</li>
    <li><strong>In-app purchases:</strong> If we ever add optional purchases, the platform’s terms apply. We will disclose prices before purchase.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7) Wellness (non-medical) notice</h2>
  <p>The App supports relaxation and mindfulness. It does not provide medical or mental-health advice, diagnosis, or treatment and is not a medical device. If you experience anxiety or other conditions, consult a qualified professional.</p>

  <h2>8) Devices, charges &amp; permissions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You are responsible for your device, OS version, backups, and any carrier or data charges.</li>
    <li>The App may request optional permissions (e.g., notifications, storage) solely to enable on-device features like local reminders or saving.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>9) Third-party services &amp; links</h2>
  <p>The Site may contain links to third-party sites or services. We are not responsible for their content, policies, or practices. Review their terms and privacy policies.</p>

  <h2>10) Termination</h2>
  <p>We may suspend or terminate access if you materially breach these Terms or if continued operation becomes impractical for legal or technical reasons. You may stop using the App at any time; uninstalling the App removes local data unless you have exported it.</p>

  <h2>11) Disclaimers</h2>
  <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, the App and Site are provided “as is” and “as available” without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, quiet enjoyment, and non-infringement. We do not warrant that the App or Site will be uninterrupted or error-free.</p>

  <h2>12) Limitation of liability</h2>
  <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we will not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of data, profits, or goodwill, arising from or relating to your use of the App or Site. Our total liability for any claim will not exceed the amount you paid (if any) for the App in the 12 months preceding the claim. Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations, so portions of this section may not apply to you.</p>

  <h2>13) Indemnity</h2>
  <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold us harmless from claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from your misuse of the App or Site or your violation of these Terms, to the extent permitted by law.</p>

  <h2>14) Changes to these Terms</h2>
  <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will post the updated version here with a revised “Last updated” date. Material changes may also be mentioned in the App or on the Site. Continued use after changes become effective constitutes acceptance.</p>

  <h2>15) Export &amp; sanctions compliance</h2>
  <p>You must comply with applicable export control and sanctions laws. You may not use or export the App in violation of such laws or to prohibited destinations or parties.</p>

  <h2>16) Governing law; venue</h2>
  <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of Romania, without regard to conflict-of-laws principles, and by any mandatory consumer protection rules of your country of residence. Courts in Bucharest, Romania shall have non-exclusive jurisdiction, except where local consumer law grants you the right to bring claims in your home courts.</p>

  <h2>17) Apple, Google &amp; platform terms</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>These Terms are between you and us, not Apple or Google. Apple and Google are third-party beneficiaries and may enforce applicable terms.</li>
    <li>Your use of the App must also comply with the App Store and Google Play terms and policies.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>18) Severability; entire agreement</h2>
  <p>If any provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in effect. These Terms (plus any additional policies referenced here, like our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>) are the entire agreement between you and us regarding the App and Site.</p>
