  <h2 id="who-we-are">1) Who we are</h2>
  <p><strong>My Zen Place</strong> is the data controller for the App and the Site. You can contact us via the Site’s contact form or by email at <a href="mailto:support@my-zen-place.com">support@my-zen-place.com</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="what-we-collect">2) Information we collect</h2>
  <h3>2.1 In the App</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Local app data (on device only):</strong> Your gardens/scenes, settings (e.g., audio, day/night options), and preferences are saved locally on your device. We do not receive or access this content.</li>
    <li><strong>Notifications (optional):</strong> If you enable reminders, the App schedules <em>local</em> notifications on your device. No push tokens are created and no notification data is sent to our servers.</li>
    <li><strong>Permissions:</strong> The App may request optional permissions such as notifications or file storage (for saving). These operate on-device only.</li>
    <li><strong>No tracking:</strong> The App does not use advertising identifiers, third-party analytics, or tracking SDKs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2.2 On the Site</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Contact form:</strong> If you write to us, we collect the information you submit (e.g., name, email address, and message) to respond.</li>
    <li><strong>Server/hosting logs:</strong> Our hosting provider may process standard logs (e.g., IP address, user agent, request timestamps) for security and reliability. We do not use these logs to identify you.</li>
    <li><strong>Cookies & analytics:</strong> Cookies and Advertising Technologies

        We use cookies and similar tracking technologies (such as pixels and beacons) to analyze our traffic and enhance your experience. Specifically, we use third-party services for advertising and marketing purposes.

        Google Advertising We use Google advertising services to serve ads to you. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on your prior visits to our website or other websites.

        You can opt out of personalized advertising by visiting Google Ads Settings.

        TikTok Pixel We use the TikTok Pixel to measure the effectiveness of our advertising on TikTok and to deliver targeted advertisements to you. This tool allows us to understand the actions people take on our website after seeing our ads on TikTok.

        The data collected remains anonymous to us; however, TikTok stores and processes this data. TikTok may connect this data with your TikTok account and use it for their own advertising purposes in accordance with their Data Policy.

        Your Choices You can control and manage cookies through your browser settings. Please note that removing or blocking cookies may impact your user experience.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="how-we-use">3) How we use information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To operate the App fully offline and store your content locally on your device.</li>
    <li>To deliver optional local notifications you enable.</li>
    <li>To respond to your inquiries sent through the Site’s contact form or email.</li>
    <li>To protect our services, prevent abuse, and ensure reliability (e.g., security logs).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="sharing">4) Sharing and transfers</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>We do not sell your data.</strong></li>
    <li>We do not share App data with third parties because we do not receive it.</li>
    <li>For the Site and support email, we may use service providers (e.g., hosting and email). These providers process data on our behalf under appropriate safeguards.</li>
    <li>If data is transferred outside your country (e.g., to an email provider), we rely on appropriate legal mechanisms such as Standard Contractual Clauses where required.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="retention">5) Retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>App data:</strong> Stored on your device until you delete it via in-app options (if available) or by uninstalling the App.</li>
    <li><strong>Contact messages:</strong> Retained only as long as needed to respond and manage our correspondence, then deleted or archived securely.</li>
    <li><strong>Logs:</strong> Kept for a limited period for security and troubleshooting, then deleted or anonymized.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="security">6) Security</h2>
  <p>We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect information. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. Because the App is designed to function offline, most of your content never leaves your device.</p>

  <h2 id="your-rights">7) Your privacy choices & rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>In the App:</strong> You control what you create and store. You can delete data via in-app controls (if present) or by uninstalling the App.</li>
    <li><strong>Contact data:</strong> You may request access, correction, deletion, or a copy of the information you sent us. Contact us using the methods below.</li>
    <li><strong>EU/EEA/UK residents:</strong> You may have rights under GDPR, including access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, and objection. Where we rely on consent, you can withdraw it at any time.</li>
    <li><strong>California residents:</strong> See the CCPA notice below. We do not sell or share your personal information as defined by CCPA/CPRA.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="children">8) Children’s privacy</h2>
  <p>The App is suitable for general audiences but is not intended to collect personal information from children. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age required by local law (e.g., 13 in the U.S., 16 in parts of the EU). If you believe a child provided personal information to us via the Site, please contact us so we can delete it.</p>

  <h2 id="region-notices">9) Region-specific notices</h2>
  <h3>9.1 Legal bases (EU/EEA/UK)</h3>
  <p>When we process personal data (primarily via the Site’s contact form), we rely on one or more of the following legal bases: your <strong>consent</strong> (e.g., submitting the form), <strong>contract</strong> (providing support you request), and our <strong>legitimate interests</strong> (site security, preventing abuse).</p>
  <h3>9.2 California (CCPA/CPRA)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Categories collected: identifiers and contact details you provide via the contact form; internet activity in the form of basic server logs.</li>
    <li>Business purposes: responding to inquiries; security and reliability.</li>
    <li>Sale/Sharing: we do <em>not</em> sell or share personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising.</li>
    <li>Requests: you may request access or deletion by contacting us (see below). We will not discriminate for exercising your rights.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="changes">10) Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated version here and adjust the “Last updated” date. Material changes may also be noted in the App or on the Site.</p>
